## Overview:-

### 1). Planning and design:-<br>
(i) Identify the requirements for the system, including user roles, functionalities, and features.<br>
(ii) Define the database schema for the system, including tables for books, members, loans, reservations, etc.<br>
(iii) Determine the relationships between the tables and create foreign key constraints.<br>
(iv) Decide on the API endpoints needed for the frontend to interact with the backend.<br>
(v) Design the user interface and create mockups of the screens for the frontend<br>

### 2). Setting up the Django Backend:<br>
(i) Create a new Django project and app for the library management system.<br>
(ii) Define the database schema by creating Django models for each table in the database.<br>
(iii) Implement the views and serializers needed for each API endpoint.<br>
(iv) Create URL patterns for the API endpoints.<br>

#### 3). Implementing the Angular Frontend:<br>
(i) Create a new Angular project and app for the library management system.<br>
(ii) Design and implement the user interface by creating components and services.<br>
(iii) Implement the Angular services needed to interact with the backend API endpoints using the HttpClient module.<br>
(iv) Implement authentication and authorization in the frontend by creating a login form and using Angular's guards to restrict access to certain pages.<br>
(v) Create unit tests for the frontend.<br>

## Designing the Frontend:<br>
(i) In the Angular Project, create a component of each web page of the website.<br>
(ii) Add buttons to the side-nav to navigate to the different web pages. <br>
(iii) Using routing modules, add routing to the buttons of side-nav.<br>
(iv) Design all the web pages using HTML,CSS,etc. and make the website responsive.<br>
